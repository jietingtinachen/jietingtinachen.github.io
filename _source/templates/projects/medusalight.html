	<h2> Lighting design for space hotel</h2>
	<div class="dottedline"></div>
	<p>
		The lighting system for space hotel is designed to help guests acclimatise to their new environment.
		In the absence of natural sunlight and gravity, lighting elements can provide illumination, visual
		cues for spacial orientation, and chronological markers. With these goals in mind, we designed a
		selection of treatments, products and installations.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lit horizon line uses a cycle of subtle bio-dynamic lighting to simulate the daily chromatic
		light cycle on earth around the hotel whilst providing a line of reference for orientation.
	</p>
	<p>
		To assist orientation and provide interactive fun in the space hotel, the shadow floor is a surface
		animation that creates the illusion of casting a ‘shadow’ while floating in a zero gravity environment.
		The illuminated doorway allow guests to flow fluidly between rooms, while maintaining privacy through
		the unique angle of the entrances opening.
	</p>
	<p>
		A serious comforting personal lamp that can be used to create a visual focal point and provide task
		lighting. Lamps can be grouped together to illuminate shared space.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project was a collaboration with Alicia Tam and Jessi Baker. A section of the full size model was made and exhibited during London Design Festival 2010.
