	<p>A pair of shoes fitted with sensors and a micro-controller which are then hardwired into a mobile phone. A granular audio synthesizer and sequencer software is loaded onto the handheld device.
	</p>

	<p>The performer can tune their shoes for a short duration by moving their feet in different directions. Each movement creates a unique sound. Once the tuning session has completed the users can move their feet in any way to generate customized drum and bass beats.
	</p>

	<p>The thick, colorful cables running from the shoes to the device bring out a retro fashion to the performer.
