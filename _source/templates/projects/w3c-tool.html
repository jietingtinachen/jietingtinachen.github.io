	<h1> W3C tool site design </h1>
	<h2> UX / UI / Art direction </h2>
	<div class="dottedline"></div>
	<p> 
		The W3C Digital Data Standard brings all web technologies onto one single data model and allows technologies to plug-and-play, without the need for vast amounts of custom coding each time. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		I have helped them with Art direction including logo, color palette and brand language. Iâ€˜ve designed the whole website, including all the illustrations.
	</p>
	<p> 
		The biggest challenge while I was designing is to explain abstract technology with visual language, I needed to come up with metaphorical visual system that makes sense. The end result is a clean, fun, and easy to understand website which meet all the requirements.
