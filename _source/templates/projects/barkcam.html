	<p>
		BarkCam is a fun app to take photos of your dogs.
		The problem was that every time you try to take a photo of them, they just won't look at the camera. With BarkCam, you can choose any sound from a grumpy cat to a dinosaur roar to make sure your dogs look at the camera with their cutest faces!
	</p>
	<p>
		After that, you can also choose all sorts of filters, stickers, speech bubble to decorate the photos.
	</p>
	<p>
		Iâ€™ve handcrafted this app from user experience to all the UI work including every icons and stickers. I've also art directed the branding materials including logo, photos and promotional collateral.
